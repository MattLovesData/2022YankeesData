Welcome to my portfolio project, where I combine the power of Excel, SQL to explore and extract insights from the 2022 New York Yankees pitching statistics. This project showcases my skills in data manipulation, analysis, and creative problem-solving using diverse tools and datasets.

Data Sources:
For this project, I have sourced comprehensive pitching statistics from two reliable baseball data websites: baseballreference.com and baseballsavant.mlb.com. These datasets provide a rich and detailed overview of the 2022 Yankees' pitching performance, including player statistics, game logs, and more. These sources are well-regarded in the baseball analytics community for their accuracy and comprehensiveness. For this project I was interested in taking a look at the general performance of Yankees pitchers in 2022, Gerrit Cole's statistics, and the last pitch in a pitching sequence when action is taken- for example a walk, strikeout, hit, or homerun. I extracted data from baseballreference.com and baseballsavant.mlb.com based on these parameters, cleaned my data in excel, and exported both sheets as csv files in order to import them to Microsoft SQL Studio. I've provided the excel files as well as the finished csv files above.

Tools Used:

Excel: I've employed Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

SQL: Structured Query Language (SQL) is the backbone of this project. I've employed SQL to explore, query, and extract meaningful insights from the Yankees' pitching data. SQL offers the flexibility and efficiency needed to analyze large datasets and generate valuable reports.

ChatGPT: I've utilized ChatGPT to generate questions related to our data. These questions serve as prompts for the SQL queries.

Project Goals:
The primary objective of this portfolio project is to demonstrate my proficiency in leveraging data analysis tools and techniques to answer meaningful questions about the 2022 New York Yankees' pitching performance.

The "SQL_Queries" link above and the code written therein is the final product of this project, you shouldn't need to download anything- it's really just a demonstration of my current SQL ability. The other links available are the various data sources I used along the way so you are able to see the full process if you're interested.
