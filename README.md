Welcome to my portfolio project, where I combine the power of Excel, SQL to explore and extract insights from the 2022 New York Yankees pitching statistics. This project showcases my expertise in data manipulation, analysis, and creative problem-solving using diverse tools and datasets.

Data Sources:
For this project, I have sourced comprehensive pitching statistics from two reliable baseball data websites: baseballreference.com and baseballsavant.mlb.com. These datasets provide a rich and detailed overview of the 2022 Yankees' pitching performance, including player statistics, game logs, and more. These sources are well-regarded in the baseball analytics community for their accuracy and comprehensiveness.

Tools Used:

Excel: I've employed Microsoft Excel for data cleaning, transformation, and visualization.

SQL: Structured Query Language (SQL) is the backbone of this project. I've employed SQL to explore, query, and extract meaningful insights from the Yankees' pitching data. SQL offers the flexibility and efficiency needed to analyze large datasets and generate valuable reports.

ChatGPT: I've utilized ChatGPT to generate questions related to ourdata. These questions serve as prompts for SQL queries.

Project Goals:
The primary objective of this portfolio project is to demonstrate my proficiency in leveraging data analysis tools and techniques to answer meaningful questions about the 2022 New York Yankees' pitching performance. By combining Excel, SQL, and ChatGPT, I aim to showcase my ability to:

Clean, preprocess, and prepare raw data for analysis.
Construct and execute SQL queries to extract specific insights.
Present actionable recommendations based on the data-driven insights.
Why This Project Matters:
Baseball is not just a sport; it's a treasure trove of data waiting to be explored. This project highlights the significance of data analysis in sports, demonstrating how it can provide valuable insights for teams, coaches, and fans alike. By delving into the 2022 Yankees' pitching performance, we can uncover trends, identify areas for improvement, and gain a deeper understanding of the team's dynamics.

The "SQL_Queries" link above is the final product of this project, it's really just a demonstration of my current SQL ability. The other links available are the various data sources I used along the way so you are able to see the full process if you're interested.
